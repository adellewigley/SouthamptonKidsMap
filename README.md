# Southampton Kids Map

This project was created as a competition entry for a Code First Girls BAsic Web Development Course

The motivation behind this project was to create a basic website where I could implement the skills learnt on the course: *CSS, HTML and Javascript,* as well as implement a simple web map based on *Leaflet.*

The website template is built upon the one page Bootstrap *Full Width Pics* theme.
